# LOGS (SANITIZED)

This folder holds sanitized, public-facing versions of log entries used for pattern analysis.  
These are abstracted data points — *not* personal diaries.

## Includes
- symbolic summaries  
- synchronicity abstractions  
- event pattern summaries  
- song/symbol/geographic log abstractions  
- structured entries using the LOG_TEMPLATE.md format  

## Does Not Include
- raw autoethnography  
- personal details  
- timestamps tied to vulnerable events  
- names, locations, or identifiable relationships  
- medical or legal information  

## Naming Convention
YYYY-MM-DD_logtype_###.md
